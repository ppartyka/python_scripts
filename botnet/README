Python Version 2.7.X

Non-Standard Modules:
pexpect
pxssh

Preconditions:

'svr' variable - assumes that you have at least 1 server that you can connect to
via hostname or IP. Replace serverN with your server IPs or hostnames. e.g.

svr = [ '192.168.1.5' ] 

auth_check - 'hashed sha513 password' requires that the user provided a hashed sha512 value e.g.:

'cbe0cd68cbca3868250c0ba545c48032f43eb0e8a5e6bab603d109251486f77a91e46a3146d887e37416c6bdb6cbe701bd514de778573c9b0068483c1c626aec'

To get a hased password, lookup the hashme.py program on my blog or do the following from your command line:

python
>>> import hashlib
>>> hashlib.sha512('Password1').hexdigest()

This will give you a hashed value for 'Password1' or whatever text you substitute it with.

S = login(box, 'username', 'password') - username and password should be replaced with the username and password
for the server or servers you provided. If you have a different username and pass for every server you are connecting
to then all you have to do is rewrite with a dictionary :) Maybe I'll upload a version that does something like that.
