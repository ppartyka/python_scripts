This script came into existence because we needed a quick fix for a way
to keep track of some ticketing. It is a very simple ticketing system that
increments the ticket number and sends ticket information to an email account
where you can keep track of said tickets.

This script is using python3

The libs are standard:
smtplib
time

You HAVE to creat the file for the "ticket" variable. 

I've used tnum.txt and it is in the directory where the script lives. 

Also this has been tested on the following systems:
CentOS 6.4
Ubuntu 12.X +
Kali Linux
BT5 R3
