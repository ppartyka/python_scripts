Word list is a simple app that pulls words from a webpage and gives you a list.

usage goes something like this:

wordlist.py http://www.ppartyka.com filename > list.txt

This will create a filename.html in the directory you ran wordlist.
The html file will still have html tags intact. 

> list.txt will redirect the output into the file list.txt

If you do not redirect output it'll just display onto the screen so:

wordlist.py http://www.ppartyka.com filename 

will output the parsed words onto the screen.

wordlist.py works on python 2.X and NOT with python 3.X

Tested on linux and unix platforms without issues, but has
not been tested on windows... 

modules used are:
urllib
HTMLParser
sys
